    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I'm currently a student at Dev BootCamp. I'm attending at the San Fransisco location, because I'm a California person through and through. I've lived in LA, the Bay Area, and even grew up mostly tucked back in the redwood forest around Santa Cruz. This gave me a breadth of experience that I've found incredibly valuable.

      Although I find programming very satisfying, it's far from the only thing that brings me joy. I enjoy crafts, from knitting and crochet to cross stitch. I occasionally sit down and do digital painting, and I love reading. I particularly enjoy that my husband likes to read me while I knit or cross-stitch, which is a perfect combination of relaxing elements.
    </p>

      In a similar fashion, my education has been very broad. I have studied musical theatre, American Sign Language, and birth (from a support capacity, not medical). Although each of these has it's merits, they generally don't fit in with my goals in life, and getting into programming has shown me that there's a way to balance my life and my career in a satisfying way.

      Fun Fact: My first lead acting role happened the first time I auditioned for bit parts in lieu of a main role. Got a call that they wanted me for the main role (and was equally excited that my parents then let me read for an extra hour to calm down after instead of going to sleep at the normal time. Ah, the simple joys of childhood.)
