  -tests are a tool
  - waht will the code do? How do I test? Does it Fail? Good. Write code to make pass.
  - do this from the start rather than waste money later having someone fix it

  -TDD vs Test oriented vs test driven DESIGN vs tDD & design
  -use of tests as documentation
  - TDD and good unit tests are separate skills
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWayn0QsJr8-
  - design-implement-test becomes design/test-implement
  - allows more confident programming
  -these are unit tests not system tests
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9quxZsLcfo - is TDD dead (pt 1/6)

      <H2>Test Driven Development</H2>
      <H3>or How to Increase Productivity</H3>
      <h4>11/1/15</h4>
      <p> Test driven development (or TDD) is "a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards"(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Wikipedia</a>). By using small unit tests to drive forward the development, we can be assured of workable code at any point in the development process. </p>
      <p>One thing to remember is that simply going through the motions isn't helpful. Tests are ultimately tools to take you where you want to go, but they have to be used well to be truly useful. Well written tests that are written for sufficiently small blocks of code can be used to simultaneously modularize the code and make more dynamic and to serve as documentation of the code you are writing. Test can be written badly and left as documentation, in which case, others will be unable to easily work on the code. This also helps keep your code from running into the trap of having too much assigned to any one method or object. It needs just enough to be functional, and does not need features that haven't been requested yet. Those requested features are easier to implement when they are requested when using good tests. </p>
      <p>By implementing a design/ test then code methodology, it is easier to be confident in the code you are writing, because you can check at every turn to make sure it is functional, and not only that, but functioning in precisely the manner expected. You also have a quick way to test whether new code is breaking previous functionality, as all of the previous tests will also run. As a developer, it will take less time to start with TDD and move on to working on the code continuously than it does  to write the code and come back for testing and debugging. As a employer, it will take less time and money to hire someone who does TDD upfront rather than needing someone else to come in later and sort out the programming. </p>
