        Hashes and Arrays - Storing Stuff and Data in Ruby - 10-5-15
      </H2>
      <p><em>
        DISCLAIMER: THE FOLLOWING IS FROM A SERIES OF POST MADE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF MY TIME AT DEV BOOT CAMP, AND THEREFORE MAY CONTAIN INCONSISTENCIES AND MISINFORMATION AS THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE WEEK I LEARN A NEW CONCEPT. TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

      <p>
        Alrighty! This week I've been learning a lot about Ruby, and I'd like to introduce you to my new... friends, we'll call them. Arrays and Hashes. While at first glance they could seem similar, and even are in many ways, they have different uses. While this won't be an in-depth view, I hope it is enough to introduce you to the concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start with, arrays are a collection of data. That data can consist of integers, floats (which are numbers with decimal points), strings (such as words or the like, that is read by the computer as simply being a string of characters with no meaning to it), or even other arrays!
      </p>
      <code>
        array = array.new[1,2,3,"Apple","Cat","Vase", ["This is a second array"]]
      </code>
      <p>
        As you can see above, arrays can contain all sorts of information. This is useful for storing lists or taking a lot of numbers that can then be sorted and looked through easily, no matter how large the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hashes, on the other hand, are quite like arrays in that they store data. However, for hashes, there is always a two value system in place, consisting of the key and the value. The key is a unique value in that hash, that will always result in the calling of its value. Multiple keys can have the same value, but no two values can share a key.
      </p>
      <code>
        H = Hash["a" => 100, "b" => 200]
      </code>
      <p>
        As you an see, A hash looks very similar to an array. However, calling H[b] now calls up the value 200. In this case it probably seems small. But say you wanted to create a phone list or address book? You could have a handful of hashes, and call Phone[Deanna] or Address[Deanna] to quickly look up the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        So that's a quick primer on the uses of hashes and arrays! Hope it was informative!
