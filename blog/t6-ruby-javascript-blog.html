        Hashes Vs Objects - Or Why Is There A Cannibal In My Code - 10-25-15

        So today I'm going to talk a little about Ruby hashes and Javascript objects. I'm not going to lie, this one is a bit complicated, and largely semantic. First I shall give you an example of a normal example of a Ruby hash, and then of a JavaScript object.
      </p>
      <code><pre>
          #Ruby Hash Codeblock
          last_names = {
            "Deanna" => "Warren"
            "Clarice" => "Starling"
            "Hannibal" => "Lecter"
          }
      </pre></code>
      <code><pre>
        // JavaScript Object Codeblock
        var lastNames = {
          deanna: "Warren",
          clarice: "Starling",
          hannibal: "Lector",
        }
      </pre></code>
      <p>
        To be fair, these examples are similar, but I think that's why I've had such trouble with them. They are exceedingly similar. However, there are a couple of differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, in JS there's a focus on manipulating the properties in an object, so while this isn't a great example, it is still a valid one. (I'll throw a more objecty one at the end). In JS, it is also required that the properties be accessible, which makes the first value by neccesity a variable. That is why they are lowercase and not in quotes for a string. Ruby on the other hand can take just about anything as a 'key' for it's pairs. Ruby focuses more on storing paired information. However, if you want, you can use these syntatical codeblocks very similarly. It really comes down to the intent of the language. They are intended for different things, and make more sense in one language than another. The above example is more of a hash-style codeblock; keeping the same syntax, let's look a little closer at Clarice Starling as a more objecty object, and therefore more of a JS style.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a quick side note, you can actually use the word: notation in Ruby to create a symbol type of variable. I will probably do so below, because Ruby is about accessing the information, and JS is about accessing the properties, so it's appropriate.
      </p>
        <code><pre>
          #Ruby Hash Codeblock
          agent_starling = {
            first_name: "Clarice"
            first_seen: "Silence of the Lambs"
            last_seen: "Hannibal"
            romantic_partner: "Hannibal Lecter"
          }
      </pre></code>
      <code><pre>
        // JavaScript Object Codeblock
        var agent_starling = {
            firstName: "Clarice"
            firstSeen: "Silence of the Lambs"
            lastSeen: "Hannibal"
            romanticPartner: "Hannibal Lecter"
          }
        }
      </pre></code>
      <p>
        So that's a more JS look at the pair of data structures. Don't worry, it's a bit confusing on this side too. Basically, the first set are more Ruby-ish, and the second set are more JS-ish, and you just have to keep track of the intent of the language.
