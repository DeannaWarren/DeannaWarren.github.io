        Building a Website Reflection - Last Requirement - 11-8-15
      </H2>
      <p><em>
        DISCLAIMER: THE FOLLOWING IS FROM A SERIES OF POST MADE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF MY TIME AT DEV BOOT CAMP, AND THEREFORE MAY CONTAIN INCONSISTENCIES AND MISINFORMATION AS THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE WEEK I LEARN A NEW CONCEPT. TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

      <p>
        This is, I believe, my last required post with Dev Boot Camp. Today I'm going to reflect on the process of building a website.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built this website to the best of my abilities. When I originally made it, using only HTML/CSS that I wrote, it looked like this:
      </p>
      <img src="/blog/blog-imgs/personal-site-11-1.png" alt="A website much like this one, with blue color scheme. Elements are boxed, and the columns of the front page are slightly uneven. There is very little text reading 'This is the Website of Deanna Warren' and a subheading 'Dev Bootcamp Student'. There is a photo of the author.">
      <p>
        At current moment, my website does not look like that. Nor is is where I'd like it to be. I transfered my website to a Foundation framework this week, and it was a lot more difficult that I expected. However, I was faced with the choice of working it out and having the tools to figure it out from here with a variety of premade CSS classes to work from, such as I used to create the navigational bar I'm using at the moment, or a simple class used to center text.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would be interested in doing some more work on the site, like making my blog posts look a little more interesting, or fancying up the lists on my blog index and project index. And lord, do I have some writing to do to fix up my about me and the like! Luckily, my husband is taking a copywriting course, so I'm talking him into rewriting my stuff, because talking about yourself is so much harder than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed making this site, but I wish that I'd decided to go with the full framework rather than the CDN right away, because my limited experience with this framework ended up meaning I didn't know what which things to use, because I didn't know what I needed! I might be able to fix it up again with the CDN in the future, but for now, I just need to be able to  take a breath, jump into the onsite portion of the course, and just be proud of what I've done.
