How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  I found it a little silly to wireframe and make seperate pages like this, but I think if we were working on a singular project and particularly if we were in a physical space together it would have been really helpful.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  I think wireframing is really helpful and lets me see where I want my code to go from here. There are limitations from not using formatting but I know where I'm going.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We both used pretty open formats. I've seen some that include lines for where text goes and I find it easier to just block off specific areas.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  I didn't learn anything new in this project but I helped my pair learn about semantic layouts with things like aside. I'm new to it too but I think I understand how I'm going to use it.
