      Version Control- Why It Matters - Git, GitHub, and Branches - 9/12/15
    </H2>
    <p><em>
      DISCLAIMER: THE FOLLOWING IS FROM A SERIES OF POST MADE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF MY TIME AT DEV BOOT CAMP, AND THEREFORE MAY CONTAIN INCONSISTENCIES AND MISINFORMATION AS THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE WEEK I LEARN A NEW CONCEPT. TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

    <p>
      Hello! This is my first post on my technical blog! Today I'm going to discuss version control, something I've been learning a lot about this week, that was crucial to me being able to make this blog, and will only be more important as my learning progresses. You may be asking yourself "What is version control? What are git and GitHub? Don't branches belong on trees instead of in computers?" Worry not, dear reader. It is my goal today to answer these questions and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what exactly is version control? It's quite simple really. Version control is what developers use to track changes in their code. You may have seen programs listed as 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and wondered what that means. It simply means what version of the code is being used! Now those changes are on a larger scale, consisting of many small changes, but version control can be used down to a single line of code being changed. This enables the developer to quickly look back through the code and see what was done, when, and even why if good messages are used with each 'save point'. This is where branches become important. You can think of branches very much like the branches on a tree. The main code, usually the working code that is being actively used, is commonly called the master branch, but can really be considered the trunk of our code tree. Each new branch is a copy of the code it is being pulled off of, which is often the master branch, but can also be a branch itself. When changes are made to this code, it doesn't affect the master branch until it is completed and implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is good practice for even a single developer, but if you imagine a room full of people working on a single project, it quickly become apparent that having seperate branches is very useful. Different people can work on the code without worrying about the changes being made by others. In this case, there is the added benefit of an extra pair of eyes looking over the changes in the code to check for bugs before merging it with the master branch. In this way, productivity is increased as well as accuracy. Each time a change is made to a branch, or a branch is merged into the master, we get a 'save point' called a 'commit'. We can look back at these commits to see what has been done, but we can also revert back to them if the code is somehow broken or unuseful.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does that have to do with this git thing? Do I have something against the creaters of version control and want to call them a rude name? Nope! Git is a version control system, that is to say a sort of program to facilitate the tracking of the changes as discussed above. It creates easily used function for creating branches, cloning a project from a remote location (more on that in a minute), and doing a commit on changes. It is used with a remote repository, or complete file folder of the project. This enables a consistent backup of your project and all the commits, and also a central location (or Hub if you will) for group projects to be run from.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub, as it's name suggests, is a 'Hub' for users of git. Code projects, or repositories, can be stored on it, as well as information on open branches. The whole repository can be cloned, or copied, to your local hard drive for you to work on. In this way, GitHub is a good partner to git and the ease of use contributes to it being a very popular version control tool. Information locally can be updated from the remote repository, and the remote can also be updated with the commits made on your local computer! In this way, GitHub contributes to greater freedom for developers.

      I hope this information has been helpful!
